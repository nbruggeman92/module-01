## Description

- My motivation for this project was to refactor the CSS/HTML code of a webpage with semantic elements for better organization.
- I built this project to demonstrate that I am capable of following instructions and making helpful changes to code.
- My project provides better organization to the coding of a webpage without sacrificing any core elements previously established.
- I learned how to use semantic elements to improve the structure of coding and got more practice deploying my work to Github.
